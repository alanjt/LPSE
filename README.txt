# LPSE

This is a small airfield at the foot of PortugalÂ´s highest mountain - Serra da Estrela (1993 m). It is mainly used as a base for fixed wing fire fighting aicraft.

Installation

Make a directory for your local scenery. On my system this is C:\Flightgear\MyScenery.

Copy all files and directories from the LPSE directory into this local scenery directory.

Add the local scenery directory to your Flightgear start options  e.g. :-
 
 --fg-scenery=C:\FlightGear\MyScenery
